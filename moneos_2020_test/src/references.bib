  abstract = {Our understanding of the recruitment of estuarine fishes has been strongly influenced by two views: first, that estuaries are important nurseries and second, that many species are estuarine dependent. Based on an attempt to review the world-wide literature on these topics, it appears that both of these views have merit but could benefit from additional attention and clarification. The term estuarine dependency is used in a variety of ways depending on the author and context and even how one defines estuary. Further, and perhaps most importantly, we often lack the comparative data on habitat use by fishes in the ocean vs. the estuary to make judgments about dependency. To that end we have analyzed the distribution patterns of fish species along the estuarine-coastal ocean ecotone in southern New Jersey, U.S. to evaluate the fish response. As a result, it appears the degree of estuarine use is quite variable among species, as well as at geographic, annual and cohort-specific scales. Thus, further synthesis is necessary and it might focus on: first, more information on fish use in different types of estuaries across a broad geographical range; second, a better understanding of the functional significance of habitats across the habitat landscapes of the estuary\textendash{}ocean ecotone; third, any further synthesis needs to incorporate of the role of biotic variables (e.g. predation, competition) in order to enhance our understanding of the degree of estuarine dependency; fourth, we need to determine how freshwater flow into estuaries might influence habitat use especially with regard to the potential role of the offshore estuary.},

  abstract = {Determining the links among estuarine hydrography, habitat and spawning of estuarine-dependent fish is essential for understanding reproductive dynamics, recruitment processes and directing conservation efforts. Acoustic tracking was used to evaluate fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns in spawning activity of Percalates colonorum (estuary perch) within the Shoalhaven River, south-eastern Australia. Plankton tows were used to determine the timing of spawning events. Tagged P. colonorum exhibited movements restricted to areas of structurally complex large wooden debris and a concrete ferry landing. Egg counts confirmed that spawning events coincided with adult aggregations, whereas egg abundances peaked at night during the first 2 h of the run-out tide. We postulate that spawning and recruitment success of P. colonorum is attributable to its selective spawning habitats that are (1) structurally complex to provide refuge and protection from predation, as well as congregate prey items, (2) adjacent to deep water of high velocities to maximise egg dispersal and (3) in close proximity to river entrance to facilitate coastal dispersal of eggs and inter-estuarine connectivity of larvae.},

  abstract = {The relationship between poor water quality and migration opportunities for fish remains poorly documented, although it is an essential research step in implementing EU water legislation. In this paper, we model the environmental constraints that control the movements of anadromous and catadromous fish populations that migrate through the tidal watershed of River Scheldt, a heavily impacted river basin in Western Europe. Local populations of sturgeon, sea lamprey, sea trout, Atlantic salmon, houting and allis shad were essentially extirpated around 1900. For remaining populations (flounder, three-spined stickleback, twaite shad, thinlip mullet, European eel and European smelt), a data driven logistic model was parameterized. The presence or absence of fish species in samples taken between 1995 and 2004 was modelled as a function of temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, river flow and season. Probabilities to catch individuals from all diadromous species but three-spined stickleback increased as a function of the interaction between temperature and dissolved oxygen. The hypoxic zone situated in the freshwater tidal part of the estuary was an effective barrier for upstream migrating anadromous spawners since it blocked the entrance to historical spawning sites upstream. Similarly, habitat availability for catadromous fish was greatly reduced and restricted to lower brackish water parts of the estuary. The model was applied to infer preliminary dissolved oxygen criteria for diadromous fish, to make qualitative predictions about future changes in fish distribution given anticipated changes in water quality and to suggest necessary measures with respect to watershed management.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, river fragmentation is primarily responsible for the decline of populations of migrating fish. In particular, anadromous fish species, which necessarily migrate to fresh water to reproduce, are endangered since many are no longer able to reach their natural spawning sites. In addition, pollution of rivers effectively prevents upstream or downstream movements and blocks access to spawning grounds. This article investigates how poor water quality interferes with the life history cycle of twaite shad Alosa fallax fallax (Lac{\'e}p{\`e}de, 1803), an anadromous clupeid fish, in the watershed of River Scheldt, a heavily impacted environment in West Europe. We used two models based on known ecological and environmental information to explain past and present twaite shad distribution within the watershed and to make inferences about a future population recovery and juvenile habitat value. We demonstrated that historical spawning areas satisfy water quality conditions necessary to support spawning and successful development of early life history stages of the twaite shad. However, poor water quality conditions just upstream the freshwater-saltwater boundary still act as an effective migration barrier for upstream movement. As a consequence spawning grounds are inaccessible and the population is dominated by seasonal adults occurring in the lower estuarine part of the watershed. This article provides testable and diagnostic information to the watershed management in that it identifies habitat and water quality requirements needed to support the expected recovery of an endangered anadromous fish population.},

Classifications (based on Bray\textendash{}Curtis similarities derived from occurrence, number and mass data) of the different fish categories (postlarvae and juvenile\textendash{}adults of each species) revealed two main trophic guilds, whose preferential prey (SIMPER analysis) were mysids and copepods, respectively. The similarity matrices derived from occurrence, number and mass data were always significantly correlated (RELATE: r{$>$}0.636; P{$<$}0.01), indicating that a good agreement in feeding patterns emerged from these variables. The seasonal coincidence of maximal fish and key-prey species densities suggests that food availability may be a principal factor influencing the nursery function of the Guadalquivir Estuary.},

This Flemish Fish Monitoring Network aims to assess fish populations in public waters at regular time intervals in both inland waters and estuaries. This monitoring was set up in support of the Water Framework Directive, the Habitat Directive, the Eel Regulation, the Red List of fishes, fish stock management, biodiversity research, and to assess the colonization and spreading of non-native fish species. The collected data are consolidated in the Fish Information System or VIS. From VIS, the occurrence data are now published at the INBO IPT as two datasets: `VIS - Fishes in inland waters in Flanders, Belgium' and `VIS - Fishes in estuarine waters in Flanders, Belgium'. Together these datasets represent a complete overview of the distribution and abundance of fish species pertaining in Flanders from late 1992 to the end of 2012. This data paper discusses both datasets together, as both have a similar methodology and structure. The inland waters dataset contains over 350,000 fish observations, sampled between 1992 and 2012 from over 2,000 locations in inland rivers, streams, canals, and enclosed waters in Flanders. The dataset includes 64 fish species, as well as a number of non-target species (mainly crustaceans). The estuarine waters dataset contains over 44,000 fish observations, sampled between 1995 and 2012 from almost 50 locations in the estuaries of the rivers Yser and Scheldt (``Zeeschelde''), including two sampling sites in the Netherlands. The dataset includes 69 fish species and a number of non-target crustacean species. To foster broad and collaborative use, the data are dedicated to the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero waiver and reference the INBO norms for data use.},
